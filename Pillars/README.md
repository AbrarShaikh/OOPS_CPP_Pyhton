# Data Abstraction 
- Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.
- Hiding internal details and showing functionality.
- Abstraction is achieved by __interfaces__ and abstract classes.
- Classes are ADT-abstract data types.
- The abstract method contains only method declaration but not implementation.
- it reduces __complexity__, isolates impact of change

# Encapsulation
- Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit (Class) is known as encapsulation.
- It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.
- Data encapsulation is most __strick__ feature of class.
- Encapsulation also leads to data abstraction or data hiding.
- Data (access specifier = private) is not accessible to the outside world.
- In encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, which is similar to what data-hiding.
- it reduces __complexity__, increases __security__ and __reusibility__.

# Inheritance
- Inheritance allows us to create a new class (derived class) from an existing class (base class).
- one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of the parent object.
- It supports conecpt of __hieratchical classicfication__.
- Eliminates __redundencies__, increases __resuibilty__ by extending use of existing class.

# Polymorphism
- Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
- differentiate between entities with the same name efficiently.
- Different situations may cause an operation to behave differently. The type of data utilized in the operation determines the behaviour.
- polymorphism is implemented with the help of Compile time polymorphism (function overloading, operator overloading), and Run time polymorphism (virtual functions) and function overriding.
