# OOPs vs POPs
- objects are a primary source in OOP to implement what is to happen in the code (to model real-world problems).
- Unlike procedural programming, where functions are written to perform operations on data, OOP involves creating objects that contain both data and functions.
- in POPs: the program is organized around its code (what is happening/Algorithms) --> "code acting on data".
- in POPs: the program is organized around Data (what is being affected) --> "data controlling access to code"
- OOP allows decomposition problems into a number of entities (objects), then builds data and functions around it.
- OOP emphasis on Data rater than procedure.
- The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.
