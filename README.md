# OOPs vs POPs
- objects are a primary source in OOP to implement what is to happen in the code (to model real-world problems).
- Unlike procedural programming, where functions are written to perform operations on data, OOP involves creating objects that contain both data and functions.
- in POPs: the program is organized around its code (what is happening/Algorithms) --> "code acting on data".
- in OPPs: the program is organized around Data (what is being affected) --> "data controlling access to code"
