# OOPs vs POPs
- objects are a primary source in OOP to implement what is to happen in the code (to model real-world problems).
- Unlike procedural programming, where functions are written to perform operations on data, OOP involves creating objects that contain both data and functions.
- in POPs: the program is organized around its code (what is happening/Algorithms) --> "code acting on data".
- in POPs: the program is organized around Data (what is being affected) --> "data controlling access to code"
- OOP allows decomposition problems into a number of entities (objects), then builds data and functions around it.
- OOP emphasis on Data rather than procedure.
- The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

# Object
- It is a basic unit of OOP and represents the real-life, run-time entities.
- every object can be distinguished from one other.
- An object has two characteristics: attributes and behaviour(action).
- Attributes can be represented by variables and attributes by methods.
- Objects are the __instances__ of a class that are created to use the attributes and methods of a class.

# Classes
- Collection of objects is called Class. It is a logical entity.
- Class is a template, prototype, model or blueprint for creating the objects.
- It describes the attributes and behaviour performed by its objects
- It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.
